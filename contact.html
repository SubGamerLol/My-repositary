    Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service
    developed by Google.Google Calendar allows users to create and edit events.
    Reminders can be enabled for events, with options available for type and
    time. Event locations can also be added, and other users can be invited to
    events. Users can enable or disable the visibility of special calendars,
    including Birthdays, where the app retrieves dates of births from Google
    contacts and displays birthday cards on a yearly basis, and Holidays, a
    country-specific calendar that displays dates of special occasions. Over
    time, Google has added functionality that makes use of machine learning,
    including "Events from Gmail", where event information from a user's Gmail
    messages are automatically added to Google Calendar; "Reminders", where
    users add to-do activities that can be automatically updated with new
    information; "Smart Suggestions", where the app recommends titles, contacts,
    and locations when creating events; and "Goals", where users enter
    information on a specified personal goal, and the app automatically
    schedules the activity at optimal times.
